# retail-lakehouse

## Overview
Modern retail lakehouse project implementing medallion architecture (Bronze/Silver/Gold) using PySpark and Delta.

This project rebuilds a transactional retail dataset using a modern lakehouse architecture with a focus on clean data modelling, reproducible transformations and production style structure.
Whilst demonstrating:

- Clear grain definition
- Medallion architecture implementation
- Structured Python based transformation pipelines
- Data modelling aligned to dimensional design principles
- Clean repository organisation and version control discipline

## Objectives
- Demonstrate clean, layered data transformation design
- Build portfolio-quality code aligned with modern data engineering practices
- Practise incremental migration from traditional warehouse patterns to lakehouse architecture
- Establish a foundation for Spark/Delta-based scaling

## Status
Currently under development

## Dataset

Online Retail II from Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mashlyn/online-retail-ii-uci/data

- ~1 million rows
- Transactional e-commerce invoice line data
- Data Grain  is one row represents one invoice line item (i.e. one product sold per transaction).
